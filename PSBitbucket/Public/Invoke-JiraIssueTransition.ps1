    .Synopsis
       Performs an issue transition on a JIRA issue, changing its status
    .DESCRIPTION
       This function performs an issue transition on a JIRA issue.  Transitions are
       defined in JIRA through workflows, and allow the issue to move from one status
       to the next.  For example, the "Start Progress" transition typically moves
       an issue from an Open status to an "In Progress" status.

       To identify the transitions that an issue can perform, use Get-JiraIssue and
       check the Transition property of the issue object returned.  Attempting to
       perform a transition that does not apply to the issue (for example, trying
       to "start progress" on an issue in progress) will result in an exception.
    .EXAMPLE
       Invoke-JiraIssueTransition -Issue TEST-01 -Transition 11
       Invokes transition ID 11 on issue TEST-01.
    .EXAMPLE
       $transition = Get-JiraIssue -Issue TEST-01 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Transition | ? {$_.ResultStatus.Name -eq 'In Progress'}
       Invoke-JiraIssueTransition -Issue TEST-01 -Transition $transition
       This example identifies the correct transition based on the result status of
       "In Progress," and invokes that transition on issue TEST-01.
    .INPUTS
       [PSJira.Issue] Issue (can also be provided as a String)
       [PSJira.Transition] Transition to perform (can also be provided as an int ID)
    .OUTPUTS
       This function does not provide output.
