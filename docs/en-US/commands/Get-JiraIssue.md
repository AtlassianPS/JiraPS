# Get-JiraIssue

## SYNOPSIS

Returns information about an issue in JIRA.

## SYNTAX

### ByIssueKey (Default)

```powershell
Get-JiraIssue [-Key] <String[]> [-Fields <String[]>] [-IncludeTotalCount]
 [-Skip <UInt64>] [-First <UInt64>] [-Session <PSObject>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ByInputObject

```powershell
Get-JiraIssue [-InputObject] <Object[]> [-Fields <String[]>] [-IncludeTotalCount]
 [-Skip <UInt64>] [-First <UInt64>] [-Session <PSObject>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ByJQL

```powershell
Get-JiraIssue -Query <String> [-Fields <String[]>] [-StartIndex <UInt32>]
[-MaxResults <UInt32>] [[PageSize] <UInt32>] [-IncludeTotalCount] [-Skip <UInt64>]
 [-First <UInt64>] [-Session <PSObject>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ByFilter

```powershell
Get-JiraIssue -Filter <Object> [-Fields <String[]>][-StartIndex <UInt32>]
 [-MaxResults <UInt32>] [[PageSize] <UInt32>] [-IncludeTotalCount] [-Skip <UInt64>]
 [-First <UInt64>] [-Session <PSObject>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This function retrieves the data of a issue in JIRA.

This function can be used to directly query JIRA for a specific issue key or internal issue ID.
It can also be used to query JIRA for issues matching a specific criteria using JQL (Jira Query Language).

> For more details on JQL syntax, see this article from Atlassian: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching)

Output from this function can be piped to various other functions in this module, including `Set-JiraIssue`, `Add-JiraIssueComment`, and `Invoke-JiraIssueTransition`.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Get-JiraIssue -Key TEST-001
```

This example fetches the issue "TEST-001".

The default `Format-Table` view of a Jira issue only shows the value of "Key", "Summary", "Status" and "Created".  
> This can be manipulated with `Format-Table`, `Format-List` and `Select-Object`

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
Get-JiraIssue "TEST-002" | Add-JiraIssueComment "Test comment from PowerShell"
```

This example illustrates pipeline use from `Get-JiraIssue` to `Add-JiraIssueComment`.

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
Get-JiraIssue -Query 'project = "TEST" AND created >= -5d'
```

This example illustrates using the `-Query` parameter and JQL syntax to query Jira for matching issues.

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
Get-JiraIssue -InputObject $oldIssue
```

This example illustrates how to get an update of an issue from an old result of `Get-JiraIssue` stored in $oldIssue.

### EXAMPLE 5

```powershell
Get-JiraFilter -Id 12345 | Get-JiraIssue
```

This example retrieves all issues that match the criteria in the saved filter with id 12345.

### EXAMPLE 6

```powershell
Get-JiraFilter 12345 | Get-JiraIssue | Select-Object *
```

This prints all fields of the issue to the console.

### Example 7

```powershell
Get-JiraIssue -Query "project = TEST" -Fields "key", "summary", "assignee"
```

This example retrieves all issues in project "TEST" - but only the 3 properties
listed above: key, summary and assignee

By retrieving only the data really needed, the payload the server sends is
reduced, which speeds up the query.

## PARAMETERS

### -Key

Key of the issue to search for.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ByIssueKey
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject

Object of an issue to search for.

```yaml
Type: Object[]
Parameter Sets: ByInputObject
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Query

JQL query for which to search for.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ByJQL
Aliases: JQL

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter

Object of an existing JIRA filter from which the results will be returned.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: ByFilter
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Fields

Field you would like to select from your issue. By default, all fields are
returned.

Allowed values:

- `"*all"` - return all fields.
- `"*navigable"` - return navigable fields only.
- `"summary", "comment"` - return the summary and comments fields only.
- `"-comment"` - return all fields except comments.
- `"*all", "-comment"` - same as above

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ByFilter
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: "*all"
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StartIndex

> NOTE: This parameter has been marked as deprecated and will be removed with the next major release.
> Use `-Skip` instead.

Index of the first issue to return.

This can be used to "page" through issues in a large collection or a slow connection.

```yaml
Type: UInt32
Parameter Sets: ByJQL, ByFilter
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 0
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MaxResults

> NOTE: This parameter has been marked as deprecated and will be removed with the next major release.
> Use `-First` instead.

Maximum number of results to return.

By default, all issues will be returned.

```yaml
Type: UInt32
Parameter Sets: ByJQL, ByFilter
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 0
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PageSize

How many issues should be returned per call to JIRA.

This parameter only has effect if `-MaxResults` is not provided or set to 0.

Normally, you should not need to adjust this parameter,
but if the REST calls take a long time,
try playing with different values here.

```yaml
Type: UInt32
Parameter Sets: ByJQL, ByFilter
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 25
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IncludeTotalCount

Causes an extra output of the total count at the beginning.

Note this is actually a uInt64, but with a custom string representation.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Skip

Defaults to 0.

```yaml

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 0
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -First

Indicates how many items to return.

```yaml
Type: UInt64
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Session

Session to use to connect to JIRA.  
If not specified, this function will use default session.
The name of a session, PSCredential object or session's instance itself is accepted to pass as value for the parameter.

```yaml
Type: psobject
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Credential

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### [JiraPS.Issue] / [String]

- If a JiraPS.Issue object is passed, this function returns a new reference to the same issue.
- If a String is passed, this function searches for an issue with that issue key or internal ID.
- If an Object is passed, this function invokes its ToString() method and treats it as a String.

## OUTPUTS

### [JiraPS.Issue]

## NOTES

This function requires either the `-Session` parameter to be passed or a persistent JIRA session.
See `New-JiraSession` for more details.
If neither are supplied, this function will run with anonymous access to JIRA.
