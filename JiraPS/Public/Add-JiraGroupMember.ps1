    .Synopsis
       Adds a user to a JIRA group
    .DESCRIPTION
       This function adds a JIRA user to a JIRA group.
    .EXAMPLE
       Add-JiraGroupMember -Group testUsers -User jsmith
       This example adds the user jsmith to the group testUsers
    .EXAMPLE
       Get-JiraGroup 'Project Admins' | Add-JiraGroupMember -User jsmith
       This example illustrates the use of the pipeline to add jsmith to the
       "Project Admins" group in JIRA.
    .INPUTS
       [JiraPS.Group[]] Group(s) to which users should be added
    .OUTPUTS
       If the -PassThru parameter is provided, this function will provide a
       reference to the JIRA group modified.  Otherwise, this function does not
       provide output.
    .NOTES
       This REST method is still marked Experimental in JIRA's REST API. That
       means that there is a high probability this will break in future
       versions of JIRA. The function will need to be re-written at that time.
