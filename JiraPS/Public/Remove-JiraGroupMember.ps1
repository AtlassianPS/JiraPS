    .Synopsis
       Removes a user from a JIRA group
    .DESCRIPTION
       This function removes a JIRA user from a JIRA group.
    .EXAMPLE
       Remove-JiraGroupMember -Group testUsers -User jsmith
       This example removes the user jsmith from the group testUsers.
    .EXAMPLE
       Get-JiraGroup 'Project Admins' | Remove-JiraGroupMember -User jsmith
       This example illustrates the use of the pipeline to remove jsmith from
       the "Project Admins" group in JIRA.
    .INPUTS
       [JiraPS.Group[]] Group(s) from which users should be removed
    .OUTPUTS
       If the -PassThru parameter is provided, this function will provide a
       reference to the JIRA group modified.  Otherwise, this function does not
       provide output.
    .NOTES
       This REST method is still marked Experimental in JIRA's REST API. That
       means that there is a high probability this will break in future
       versions of JIRA. The function will need to be re-written at that time.
