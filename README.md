## Documentation on ReadTheDocs

Documentation for PSJira has moved to [ReadTheDocs.io](http://psjira.readthedocs.io). Check it out, and feel free to submit issues or PRs against the documentation as well!

## Requirements

This module has a hard dependency on PowerShell 3.0.  There are no plans to release a version compatible with PowerShell 2, as the module relies on several cmdlets and features added in version 3.0.

## Downloading

Due to the magic of continuous integration, the latest passing build of this project will always be on the PowerShell Gallery. If you have the Package Management module for PowerShell (which comes with PowerShell 5.0), you can install the latest build easily:

```powershell
Install-Module PSJira
```

If you're using PowerShell 3 or 4, consider updating! If that's not an option, consider installing PackageManagement on PowerShell 3 or 4 (you can do so from the [PowerShell gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) using the MSI installer link).

You can also download this module from the Download Zip button on this page.  You'll need to extract the PSJira folder to your $PSModulePath (normally, this is at C:\Users\<username>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules).

Finally, you can check the releases page here on GitHub for "stable" versions, but again, PSGallery will always have the latest (tested) version of the module.

## Usage
