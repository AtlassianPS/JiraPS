We have just uploaded a new version of the **JiraPS** module to the [Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/JiraPS/2.5.0) and to [GitHub](https://github.com/AtlassianPS/JiraPS/tree/v2.5.0).

# Description

This release does not contain new features, but is an important step towards harmonizing the code across all the functions and with other AtlassianPS modules.

The full list of bugs and under the hood improvements is listed in the [changelog](#changelog).

One change that will make debugging a lot easier are the changes to `-debug` and `-verbose` across all of the functions.
Here you can see some how they changed:
